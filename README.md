Write code in Java to implement a program for searching strings in a file. You can use other programming language if you have not worked with Java before, but then you will have to find someone who can review your code during the lab session. 
1. The  minimal  requirement  is  that,  given  an  input  command  in  syntax  of  “search <pattern> <file>”, the program will print the lines where <pattern> is matched in <file>. For example, “search cat  demo.txt”, it should print all lines in demo.txt where the word cat can be found. 
2. Optional requirement is to check the Linux grep command and implement some of the command options that you are interested. For example, adding -i option to the command to ignore cases of the pattern.
